# Visualisations
We then did some more data exploration to better visualize the data and try to find some explanatory patterns. Mainly, we wanted to look at our final data set, after all the filtering, deletions and enrichment.
## Temporal analysis
We start by looking at patterns in time : 
**plot year by year**
As we can observe, the website's popularity has kept growing until 2011, but has decreased ever since. This is probably due to the competition introduced by smartphone apps ! 
**plot months**
We also observe that people review more beers in December than any other month...winter solitude or just tasting recent gifts ? 

## Geographical analysis
After extracting and enriching our data with the serving styles, we also wanted to understand how people drink their beer worldwide, or rather, what they drink it from. 
**plot distrib regions horizontal**
It seems that there are quite a few differences ! Micronesia and Sub-saharan Africa appear to almost only drink from bottles, while Melanesia likes cans. Appart from these regions, all the others seem to follow the distribution that we modeled before.
