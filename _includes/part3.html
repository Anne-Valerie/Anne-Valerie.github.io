    <h3>Which Beers Are the Most User-Friendly?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Grouping all beer styles into broader categories (Ales, Stouts, Lagers, Strong Ales, Wheat Beers, Specialty and Unique Beers, Seasonal and Celebration Beers, Sour Beers, and Historical and Traditional Beers).</li>
        <li>Counting the number of beers in each category. This was done to address the imbalance in category sizes (e.g., there are 30 ales in our dataset but only 8 stouts).</li>
        <li>Counting the number of reviews per category.</li>
        <li>Calculating the average number of reviews per category (number of reviews divided by the number of beers in the given category). This analysis was conducted to further understand the imbalance in category sizes.</li>
        <li>Counting the number of reviewers per category.</li>
        <li>Calculating the average number of reviewers per category (number of reviews divided by the number of beers in the given category). This was also performed to address the imbalance in category sizes.</li>
        <li>Counting the number of reviews from each region for every category separately. The purpose of this step was to determine which countries consume or review specific types of beers the most. At this stage, it is not possible to ascertain preferences for specific beers in different regions but rather to identify which ones are consumed or reviewed more frequently.</li>
